# cpick
Very simple windows.h command line color picker
*this works while cmd is minimized*

# Usage
- Run binary in command line and press enter while mouse hovers over the color you'd like to pick,
- to go back to the command line just use ctrl + c
- Colors are returned in the form of hex rgb values
- For extra quality of life I recommend putting the exe in your system environmental PATH variable

Only made this cuz I don't like windows powertools + the browser color picker extensions only work for the browser
